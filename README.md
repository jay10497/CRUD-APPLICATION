# CRUD-APPLICATION
 This is CRUD APPLICATION, in which I used VUE.js first time with PHP and BOOTSTRAP.
 For running project:
 1. Make sure you have wamp or xampp server installed.
 2. Then take pull or download zip file of the project.
 3. First of all, import category.sql in your server's sql database(for phpmyadmin username:root and password:).
 4. After that, simple paste all other files in wamp or xampp www folder.
 5. open web browser and open localhost, open index.html file.
